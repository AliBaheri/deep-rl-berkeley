# Hey there!

In this repo I am solving homeworks for deep reinforecement learning class.
Berkeley generously offer the 
[learning materials](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)
for this course for free.
I highly recommend it.


### Homeworks
Here you can find my solutions and write-ups for the homeworks:

* [Homework 1 - Behavioral cloning with DNN](hw1/README.md)
* [Homework 2 - Markov Decision Processes](hw2/README.md)
* [Homework 3 - Deep Q Learning](hw3/README.md)
